# ownCloud Sync Algorithm

This talk was given in 2014 at a conference at the CERN in Geneva, for me one of 
the most exciting presentations I ever gave.

Allthough it is very high level and many details have evolved since then,
it still gives a good overview of the very basics of ownCloud sync.

Maybe it is still useful to people.
